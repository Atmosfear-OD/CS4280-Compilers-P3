P3: Local option (max 100)
------------------------------------

To compile the project:
1. run 'make statSem' 
2. the program can be invoked three different ways: file specification (no extension), file redirection (with extension), and keyboard input
	file: ./statSem fileName
	redirection: ./statSem < fileName.ext
	keyboard: ./statSem 	// User then types input and presses ctrl+d to simulate EOF

Note: More than one argument will output an error message and instructions to properly run program
Note: Program output is not printed to a file
